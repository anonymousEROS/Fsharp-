// This assignment will be to write an expression evaluation function that take as arguments a 
// list of variable bindings and a string that is composed of letters and operators from the set [+ - * /$@].  
// It will scan the string from left to right, interpreting the string as an expression in 
// postfix Polish notation (except for the $ and @ special characters). 
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// All of the code you turn in must have been written by you without immediate 
// reference to another solution to the problem you are solving.  That means that you can look at 
// other programs to see how someone solved a similar problem, but you shouldn't have any code 
// written by someone else visible when you write yours (and you shouldn't have looked at a 
// solution just a few seconds before you type!).  You should compose the code you write based on 
// your understanding of how the features of the language you are using can be used to implement 
    // the algorithm you have chosen to solve the problem you are addressing.  Doing i/cutting and pasting 
// stuff you don't actually understand.  It is the only way to achieve the learning objectives of the 
// course.
